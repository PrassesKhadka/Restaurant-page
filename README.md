Skills:
HTML,CSS,JS,Webpack
Git GitHub

Lessons Learned:

CLI(Command Line Interface):
Using different command line interface commands to navigate through files and set up npm and git and github(Basic Git Workflow)

JS/ npm/ webpack:
The goal of this project was to create a restaurant page using primarily JS w/ a focus on learning JS modules(allow you to break up your code into separate files. This makes it easier to maintain a code-base. Modules are imported from external files with the import statement.And exported using export default.Modules also rely on type="module" in the script tag.),webpack, and npm. HTML content is created dynamically using a virtual DOM completely written in JS. Along w/ DOM manipulation, I also focused on delegating functions in an object-oriented way using modules. This is also the first time wrapping my head around npm, webpack, json,and webpack.config.js  .

CSS:
This page is designed to be responsive.
Used clamp,flex-box,grid and,Media queries for a responsive layout.


Updated:
Adding Babel to webpack configuration with the babel-loader.
